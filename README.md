# A Sample Spark Project

This project is IntelliJ IDEA ready, means that you can load the project into the IDE 
and run Spark job within during development, and no need to setup local Spark instance at all

To setup the project, run shell script "setup.sh", which will download the required CSV file 
to desired location for the sample project to run.
